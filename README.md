# Project Birdnest 

This is a [pre-assignment](https://assignments.reaktor.com/birdnest/) for a Reaktor Developer Trainee application. This project is licensed under MIT License.

Take a look at the app [here](https://spring-moon-3266.fly.dev/).

NOTE: This is the frontend repository. The backend is [here](https://github.com/ismomehdi/birdnest-backend/).

## About the Frontend

Most of the logic is in the [backend](https://github.com/ismomehdi/birdnest-backend/). 

The frontend uses a [websocket](https://github.com/websockets/ws) to receive data from the backend. It then renders the data using [Material UI](https://mui.com/) component library for the UI.

## Folder Structure

The folder structure is pretty simple: the `src` directory contains the `index` and `App` files. The data table UI component is in the `src/ui` directory.
